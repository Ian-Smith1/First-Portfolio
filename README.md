# First-Portfolio

This is my first attempt at a portfolio. I learned that I am struggling in a few places and need to seek help. I tried my best to look things up where I could but I need to sit down with a tutor and figure out where I am going wrong, and where I can improve my code. In the future I hope to have my portfolio looking professional and organized, however I am just not there yet. I will revise this once I have met with a tutor!
